## About

The Filebase SDK provides a hybrid data management solution, blending S3-compatible cloud storage with IPFS 
(InterPlanetary File System) pinning services. It features robust S3 bucket management, object handling for uploads and 
downloads, and seamless integration with IPFS and IPNS (InterPlanetary Naming System) for decentralized storage 
operations. The SDK supports advanced data tasks like compiling files into CAR (Content Addressable aRchive) formats and
ensures secure transactions through strong authentication. Designed for varied applications, the Filebase SDK is ideal 
for scenarios demanding the dependability of cloud storage combined with the advantages of decentralized, peer-to-peer 
storage, catering to diverse needs such as content distribution, data backup, and archival.

### JS Client

Install the package using npm

```shell
npm install filebase-sdk
```

or yarn:

```shell
yarn add filebase-sdk
```

### Getting started

The snippet below shows how to create a new bucket with `BucketManager`, upload a new object to IPFS 
with `ObjectManager`, and publish the object to IPNS with `NameManager`.   

To use the library in your project, use npm or yarn to install the [`filebase-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/filebase-sdk) module.

**node.js**
````js
import {BucketManager, ObjectManager, NameManager} from 'filebase-sdk'

createBucket S3

uploadObject IPFS

createAndPublishName IPNS
````

Full API reference doc for the JS client are available at https://filebase.github.io/filebase-sdk
